# joplin arm64 build
This repo is for storage of joplin arm64 build.
When i get my PI400 mini computer, i was so surprised for it. After installing the display device, i used it as the browser for searching some work information.
Then, one day, i wanna make some note for my searching result, testing on some open sources softwares. But there are a few builts for arm64 devices.
Joplin is one of pretty beautiful softwares. Yep, that time i cannot find any built for my PI400. So i tried to build one for my arm64 device.
After a long building time went away, including my spare time and break time. Different building methods, searching from internet, had been tried. Finally, i made it, suffering the npm dependencies lack fixed.
